Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for [Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) which I started working on in September 2016.

The Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree is an online certification. It involves
1. Courses in supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning and
2. Six projects (p0-p5 in this directory).

Courses include lecture videos, quizzes and programming problems. These courses were developed by Georgia Tech, Udacity, Google and Kaggle.

This directory includes lecture notes (`lesson_notes`) and project code (`p0` to `p5`).
