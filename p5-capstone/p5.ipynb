This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_\n",
    "- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_\n",

    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_\n",
    "- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_\n",

    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation and Validation\n",
    "In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_\n",
    "- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_\n",

    "- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis.

It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_\n",
    "- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_\n",

    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_\n",
